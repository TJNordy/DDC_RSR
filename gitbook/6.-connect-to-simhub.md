# 6. Connect to SimHub

This step is not at all necessary for controller function.

A DDC controller can send information about switch modes, bite point, and really anything you put in the bit fields to SimHub via the Dahl Design Properties plugin. Allthough the plugin is iRacing specific, this part of the plugin works regardless of which sim you are using.&#x20;

**1:** [**Download SimHub**](https://www.simhubdash.com/download-2/)****

**2:** [**Install Dahl Design Properties plugin**](https://dahl-design.gitbook.io/properties/introduction/install)****

**3: Enable controller input plugin**
