# 4. Pin headers and jumper

### Pin headers

The CB1 has 87 wire holes. With the exception of the [J1 pin header](3.-edit-pick-and-place.md#7.-j1-pin-header), and [XH connectors,](3.-edit-pick-and-place.md#3.-xh-connectors) there are no pins for these holes that comes with the board. If you want to solder the board to another board, or use jumper wires for testing/prototyping, you'll have to go buy some pin headers. The CB1 has 2.54 mm spacing.

### Jumper

For the default layout of the board, there is a [pin header](3.-edit-pick-and-place.md#7.-j1-pin-header) that allows you to switch on and off USB power by connecting these pins with a jumper. No jumper included with the board, so you might as well get some. You could of course jump the pins in many other ways, or just remove the pins and solder the holes together with a wire. Whatever floats your boat.&#x20;
