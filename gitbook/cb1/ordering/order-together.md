# Order together

Join a bulk order:

Go to the [Discord server](https://www.discord.gg/49btqWNmCc), in the #announcements channel I'll be posting bulk orders now and then. If there are no orders currently up, send me a PM and we'll see if it is time to start one.&#x20;

Typically, ordering the minimum 2 boards assembled on your own will cost around 200 EUR including shipping and taxes. The static setup fee is a big part of this price, so buying bulk will be very beneficial. In the community orders you'll get a single board for roughly 40-50 EUR.&#x20;
