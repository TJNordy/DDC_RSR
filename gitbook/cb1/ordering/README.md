# Ordering

The CB1 is not sold by me. Instead, you'll have one build just for you. Everything you need to quickly order some of these boards is available for free. You can of course also copy this circuit design and put it directly into your own circuits.&#x20;

### Disclaimer

This is not a commercial product. It is a circuit and PCB design done and tested by me, and it seems to be working perfectly. However, I will likely not be able to follow up on issues you might have in the process of ordering or setting up this board/circuit for your own designs. Nor do I have any responsibility.&#x20;

### Important before ordering

There are a few parts that are set up to be assembled, that you probably don't want to be assembled. Go through the ordering guide when making your first order. Ordering without going through the guide might offer a surprise or two.&#x20;
