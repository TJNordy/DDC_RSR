# Ordering

I'm not running a store. The idea is to keep this open and free. In this manual you'll find a guide on how to order this PCB form a PCB manufacturer. It is simpler than you'd might think, gives you a whole lot of room for customization and you might learn something useful in the process!

That being said, the CB1 has a massive setup-fee for PCB assembly, which is a fairly static fee. JLCPCB requires a minimum of 2 boards for assembly, and half the cost is the setup fee. And then comes shipping and taxes. For this reason, I'll be making some batch orders now and then if there are enough people interested. You'll be saving on both the board, the shipping and likely the taxes as well. All in all a pretty substantial reduction in cost. How much depends on how many people join the order.&#x20;

### Disclaimer

This is not a commercial product. It is a circuit and PCB design done and tested by me, and it seems to be working perfectly. However, I will likely not be able to follow up on issues you might have in the process of ordering or setting up this board/circuit for your own designs. Nor do I have any responsibility.&#x20;

### Important before ordering

Go through the ordering guide when making your first order. Ordering without going through the guide might offer a surprise or two.&#x20;
