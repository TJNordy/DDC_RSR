# Shields

Shields are circuit boards that fit on top of the CB1. They will allow you to use connectors to access the CB1 pins, making it ideal for prototyping and even finished products if you're not using a custom PCB for your switches.&#x20;

The shields use Molex Picoblade connectors, which are solid but tiny, allowing us to keep the small size format.&#x20;
