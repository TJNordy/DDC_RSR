# Robin

This shield is named after Robin Mineur, who has brought the I2C MUX, OLED features and much of the software behind this to DDC. Heâ€™s also contributed with several switch functions and spent hours beta-testing new additions to the software.

### Features

*   **1.25 mm pitch Molex Picoblade connectors**

    * _**2-pin x 15**_
      * 13 for buttons/toggles
      * 1 for  5V up to 3A current
      * 1 for 3.3V up to 1A current
    * _**3-pin x 22**_
      * 12 for analog inputs
      * 10 for encoders or 3-way toggles
    * 4-pin x 6
      * 6 for I2C devices&#x20;
        * Requires CB1 V1.3 or higher, inputs 1|1 and 1|2 will stop working if you use the I2C bus, activated by solder bridging I2C pads on the back of the CB1 board.
    *   8-pin x 2

        * 2 for funky switches



    This allows you to connect 10 encoders, 13 buttons, 12 multi-position switches/clutches/potentiometers, 2 funky switches and 6 I2C devices (sensors, OLED displays) to this shield. \


    If you need more encoders or buttons, you can mix and match with the other connectors. For instance, a 8-pin connector could also be used for 7 buttons or 3 encoders and a button. A 3-pin connector can be used for two buttons. Even the analog input connectors can be used for buttons. \


    You also have access to the 5V and 3.3V buses with 2-pin connectors, if you need to power anything. These can supply up to 3A and 1A, respectively. \


    In addition, there are two extra USB connectors for USB devices (screens, other controller boards) and a dedicated, level shifted LED line on the CB1 board.

### Pinout diagram

The shield is so tightly packed that it doen't having any labeling. Use the pinout diagram below.&#x20;

### Schematics and PCB design

The schematics and PCB design are found together with the[ CB1 project.](https://oshwlab.com/andreasdahl1987/dahl-design-cb1)

### Ordering

Order the shield using the [same approach as with the CB1,](../ordering/) in this case there arent any components to exclude, and the board is a simple 2-layer board.&#x20;

Usually I have a bit of stock on these boards, so you could also reach out to me on the [discord server.](https://discord.com/invite/49btqWNmCc)&#x20;
