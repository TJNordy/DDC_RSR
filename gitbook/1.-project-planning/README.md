# 2. Project planning

When you have an idea of which and how many switches you're going to use, you'll be best of making a plan for how to set up the switch matrix. Because even if you're not wiring the switches in a matrix, the whole firmware is based on switches having a column and row adress. Think of it as placing the switches in an Excel sheet. When refering to the switches in the code, you'll be using these adresses.&#x20;
