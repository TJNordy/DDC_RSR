# Controller settings and properties

A standard USB controller sends information about joystick axis and button states over USB. A DDC controller adds to this by also sending information about controller settings, firmware version and license status.

The DDC plugin for SimHub picks up this extra information and turns it into _properties,_ which is data available to use in all of SimHubs features.&#x20;

You can also decide what kind of settings data will be sent, allowing you to make SimHub properties from any kind of event happening in your controllers firmware.&#x20;

The SOELPEC products have recieved praise for great SimHub integration, with clutch settings, preset, switch modes and more visible and adjustable on the display of the wheel itself. SOELPEC wheels are running on DDC, so the same features are available to you.&#x20;
