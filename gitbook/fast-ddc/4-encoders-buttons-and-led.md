* Hold button 1 and 2 together for 5 seconds to restart the controller and boot as storage device.
* LEDs are running on 3.3V data in this diagram, which works up to a certain LED count. Limit is set to 30 because more is unlikely to work. For higher LED counts use a level shifter and set up a full DDC firmware.&#x20;
