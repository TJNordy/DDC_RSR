# Upload

Now that your switches are set up, your controller is ready to go. Compile and upload the sketch to your microcontroller, if everything is planned and written correctly it should now work.

Since the Windows USB device interface just shows the first 32 buttons, I suggest using [Pointy's Joystick Tester](http://www.planetpointy.co.uk/joystick-test-application/) for debugging your controller.
