# 10\_TableAndAnalog.ino

This tab is where you'll describe to the firmware how the switches are wired, and where to store all the switch information. It is divided into the digital switches using the [switch table ](switch-table.md)system, and analog switches using the [analog channel](analog-channels.md) system. Make sure you've read up on the planning and wiring part before going further here.
