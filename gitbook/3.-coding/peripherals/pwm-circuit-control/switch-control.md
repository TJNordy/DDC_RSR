# Switch control

Once your PWM channels have been set up and calibrated, we can start using switches control these channels. Any switch in the switch table or in an analog channel can be used to turn on/off PWM or adjust the volume. List of functions found[ here.](../../../switch-library/pwm-circuit-control.md)

Besides from PWM specific switch functions, switches sing functions like pushButton() can also control PWM channels using [trigger control.](trigger-control.md)
