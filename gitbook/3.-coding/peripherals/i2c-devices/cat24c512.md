# CAT24C512

Adding the necessary code for CAT24C512 EEPROM IC requires a single step:

* Setup

### Setup

The setup is done in 2\_Board.ino.  Set up your [I2C channels](./), then scroll down to this section:

```
//EEPROM CAT24C512
#define USING_CAT24C512 0
#define CAT24C512_I2C_NUMBER 0
#define CAT24C512_ADDRESS 0x50
```

<mark style="background-color:purple;">USING\_CAT24C512</mark> is to disable/enable support for this IC. Set it to 1 to enable.&#x20;

<mark style="background-color:purple;">CAT24C512\_I2C\_NUMBER</mark> lets to chose between I2C channel 0 or 1 on a RP2040 board. If you're not using a RP2040 board, just leave this at 0.

<mark style="background-color:purple;">CAT24C512\_ADDRESS</mark> is the I2C address you CAT24C512 is set up with. 0x50 is default, where address pins are all connected to ground.&#x20;

For most cases, the only thing you'll need to activate EEPROM and all its features is to flip USING\_CAT24C512 to 1.&#x20;
