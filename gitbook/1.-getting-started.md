# Introduction

### What is this?

Dahl Design Controller (DDC) is an arduino sketch that serves as a framework for creating a joystick controller. While it uses [MHeironimus's joystick library](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary) to communicate with the computer, DDC is responsible for all the algorithms and calculations between the physical button press and telling your computer what's up.

As a dedicated user of [SimHub](https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub), I've earlier used SimHub's arduino platform to code my controllers. In many ways, it works the same way as DDC - allowing the user to choose which kind of buttons are connected to the arduino, and then providing a set of algorithms that in the end uses the joystick library to communicate to computer. SimHub has a great variety of supported switches, however, there is a compromise due to the limited memory on these microcontrollers and all the other stuff that has to be included in the SimHub arduino sketch. DDC is 100% dedicated to switch algorithms, and can offer alot more complex solutions. To get the most out of a DDC controller in SimHub, install my [plugin](https://github.com/andreasdahl1987/DahlDesignProperties).

**The main benefits of using DDC:**

* Supports all kinds of switches in all kinds of wiring (including funky-switches and 2/4-bit encoders), allowing for flexible setup and the option to add a ridiculous amount of switches to a single MCU.
* Superb software debouncing for all switch/button presses.
* Complex switch functions and ability to change how switches work on the fly.
* Full RGB LED integration with SimHub for Atmel 32U4 boards.
* Great dual clutch support with different modes for different preferences.
* 12 presets to quickly change several settings - set up your own presets for different cars and sims.
* Communication with SimHub, so you'll get all relevant info from your controller avaliable as properties in the dashboard editor.
* Full control over your own firmware.
* Always evolving, new switch support will be added on request.

**The main downsides of using DDC:**

* Limited to certain microcontrollers.&#x20;
* A bit more to get your head around compared to using a setup UI as in FreeJoy and SimHub.&#x20;

### Can I use it?

There are hardware limitations to DDC. It requires you to use a microcontroller that is supported by the joystick library. When it comes to switches, encoders, hall sensors, potentiometers, etc., there are no limitations. If you can't find a function that makes your switch work - contact me and we'll improve on DDC together. See [here](supported-hardware.md) for more information.&#x20;
