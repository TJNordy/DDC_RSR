# Multiswitch complexes

Multiswitch complexes referst to rotaries and buttons/toggles working together to produce more button numbers than the individual switches could do alone.&#x20;

There are two main variants:

* Hybrid
* Multifunction

Comparison:

|                     | Hybrid                                                                                | Multifunction                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| _Switches required_ | <mark style="background-color:green;">(Encoder or 12-way switch) + 1 button</mark>    | 12-way switch + (2 buttons or single encoder)         |
| _Button numbers_    | <mark style="background-color:green;">Up to 128</mark>                                | 24                                                    |
| _Position_          | Counting                                                                              | <mark style="background-color:green;">Absolute</mark> |
| Supported sim       | Sim needs to accept simultaneous key presses as bindings. Only iRacing comes to mind. | <mark style="background-color:green;">Any</mark>      |

As you can see, both have their strengths and weaknesses. Below are the functions explained in detail. The multifunction switch functions are listed here, whie the hybrid functions are listed in the various encoder categories.&#x20;
