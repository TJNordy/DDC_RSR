# Car control functions

Here are functions that will impact the way your car drives/works. Many of them will require a sim that supports secondary throttle and brake inputs. Meaning you map out your pedals for brake and throttle, but can also use a second set of inputs that can override the pedals. iRacing supports this.&#x20;
