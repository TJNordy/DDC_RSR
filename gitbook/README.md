# Welcome

## DDC

Welcome this wiki page on DDC.

This replaces the .pdf manual I've had earlier, making it easier to post changes - as this project is always evolving.

The wiki is organized as a step-by-step guide to build and code your controller circuit. Start on [1. Instructions](https://github.com/andreasdahl1987/DahlDesignDDC/wiki/1.-Introduction) and work you way through.

### Additional resources

A start-to-finish video example of how to build a controller with DDC will soon be avaliable for purchase at [my webpage.](https://www.dahldesign.eu/)
